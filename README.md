## **An analysis of the impact of electric vehicles on emission intensity in Dutch road transport**

## Introduction  
The electrification of passenger transport plays a central role in achieving national climate goals, reducing emissions, and improving air quality (Tamba et al., 2022). Since 2018, the share of electric passenger cars (Battery Electric Vehicles, BEVs) has increased rapidly (ACEA, 2019). At the same time, the transport sector faces the challenge to not only reduce carbon dioxide emissions, but also air pollution such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM₁₀) (EEA, 2024).  

This study investigates to what extent the growth of electric passenger cars in the Netherlands between 2018 and 2023 has contributed to changes in CO₂, NOx, and PM₁₀ emissions. It analyses both total emissions (million kg) and emission intensities (g/km), assessing how they evolved over time and how they related to BEV sales. In addition, it explores whether NOx and PM₁₀ intensities declined faster than CO₂ intensity, and whether the results remain robust when excluding 2020, the pandemic year that disrupted traffic volumes.  

The analysis is based on three national datasets covering the years 2018–2023, containing detailed information on newly sold passenger cars, total kilometres driven in the Netherlands, and emissions per pollutant.  

By linking emission developments to the rise of electric vehicles, the study provides insight into the effectiveness of vehicle electrification in reducing climate and air-pollution impacts from passenger transport in the Netherlands.

## Research Question

**Main Research Question:**  
To what extent has the growth of electric passenger cars in the Netherlands between 2018 and 2023 correlated to changes in CO₂, NOx and PM₁₀ emissions from passenger cars, both in totals and per vehicle-kilometre?  

#### Sub-questions:
1. How do CO₂, NOx, and PM₁₀ totals and intensities (g/km) for passenger cars evolve over 2018–2023?  
2. How does the BEV, FCEV, and PHEV passenger-car population develop during the period 2018–2023?  
3. How are BEV, FCEV, and PHEV passenger-car changes related to annual emission intensities?  
4. How might the long-term growth in EV share affect emission intensity by 2030?

## Sub-question 1  
Between 2018 and 2023, total emissions from passenger cars in the Netherlands show a clear downward trend for all three pollutants.  This is shown in Figures 1, 2, and 3.

CO2 emissions decrease from roughly 17.5 to 15.6 million kg, while NOx falls from about 28.8 to 18.7 million kg, and PM10 remains relatively stable around 2.0 million kg. In the figure of CO2 and PM10 the sharp decline in 2020 coincides with the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to widespread lockdowns, remote working, and reduced travel activity in the Netherlands. As a result, the total number of kilometres driven by passenger cars fell by nearly 15-20% compared to previous years. This reduction in mobility is directly translated into lower total emissions, rather than a structural improvement in vehicle efficiency or technology.  


When emissions are normalized by kilometers driven, a clear downward trend can be observed for CO2 and NOx intensities between 2018 and 2023. This indicates that both technological improvements and the gradual increase in electric vehicles have improved emissions efficiency. On the other hand, the intensity of PM10 has declined only marginally, implying limited progress.

## Sub-question 2

In the figure below, we present the combined impact of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs). These three categories represent the core of the new generation of low-emission and zero-emission vehicles. By grouping them together, we aim to capture the overall contribution of this technological transition within the automotive sector. 

Since precise data on the emissions and energy consumption of each vehicle type are not yet available or vary significantly depending on usage patterns and regional factors, we assume that their environmental contributions are approximately equal. This assumption allows us to evaluate the collective effect of these advanced vehicle technologies on reducing total emissions and promoting cleaner mobility.
