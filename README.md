## Title  
**An analysis of the impact of electric vehicles on emission intensity in Dutch road transport**

## Introduction  
The electrification of passenger transport plays a central role in achieving national climate goals, reducing emissions, and improving air quality (Tamba et al., 2022). Since 2018, the share of electric passenger cars (Battery Electric Vehicles, BEVs) has increased rapidly (ACEA, 2019). At the same time, the transport sector faces the challenge to not only reduce carbon dioxide emissions, but also air pollution such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM₁₀) (EEA, 2024).  

This study investigates to what extent the growth of electric passenger cars in the Netherlands between 2018 and 2023 has contributed to changes in CO₂, NOx, and PM₁₀ emissions. It analyses both total emissions (million kg) and emission intensities (g/km), assessing how they evolved over time and how they related to BEV sales. In addition, it explores whether NOx and PM₁₀ intensities declined faster than CO₂ intensity, and whether the results remain robust when excluding 2020, the pandemic year that disrupted traffic volumes.  

The analysis is based on three national datasets covering the years 2018–2023, containing detailed information on newly sold passenger cars, total kilometres driven in the Netherlands, and emissions per pollutant.  

By linking emission developments to the rise of electric vehicles, the study provides insight into the effectiveness of vehicle electrification in reducing climate and air-pollution impacts from passenger transport in the Netherlands.

## Research Question

**Main Research Question:**  
To what extent has the growth of electric passenger cars in the Netherlands between 2018 and 2023 correlated to changes in CO₂, NOx and PM₁₀ emissions from passenger cars, both in totals and per vehicle-kilometre?  

### Sub-questions
1. How do CO₂, NOx, and PM₁₀ totals and intensities (g/km) for passenger cars evolve over 2018–2023?  
2. How does the BEV, FCEV, and PHEV passenger-car population develop during the period 2018–2023?  
3. How are BEV, FCEV, and PHEV passenger-car changes related to annual emission intensities?  
4. How might the long-term growth in EV share affect emission intensity by 2030?
