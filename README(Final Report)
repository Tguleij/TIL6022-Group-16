This project, titled “An Analysis of the Impact of Electric Vehicles on Emission Intensity in Dutch Road Transport,” investigates how the rise of electric passenger cars in the Netherlands between 2018 and 2023 has influenced emissions of CO₂, NOx, and PM₁₀. The electrification of passenger transport plays a key role in achieving climate goals, reducing air pollution, and improving air quality. Using national datasets from the Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), the analysis explores how total and per-kilometre emissions have changed in relation to the increasing share of electric vehicles.

The main research question guiding this study is: To what extent has the growth of electric passenger cars in the Netherlands between 2018 and 2023 correlated to changes in CO₂, NOx, and PM₁₀ emissions from passenger cars, both in totals and per vehicle-kilometre? To answer this, four sub-questions were addressed. The first examined how CO₂, NOx, and PM₁₀ totals and intensities evolved over time. The second investigated the development of the BEV, FCEV, and PHEV population. The third explored how changes in these vehicle types related to annual emission intensities, and the fourth projected how continued growth in electric-vehicle ownership might affect emission intensity by 2030.
