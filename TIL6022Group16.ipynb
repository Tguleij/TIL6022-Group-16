    "\n",
    "The electrification of passenger transport plays a central role in achieving national climate, reducing emissions, and improving air quality (Tamba et al., 2022). Since 2018, the share of electric passenger cars (Battery Electric Vehicles, BEVs) has increased rapidly (ACEA, 2019). At the same time, the transport sector faces the challenge to not only reduce carbon dioxide emissions, but also air pollution such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM10) (EEA, 2024). \n",
    "\n",
    "This study investigates to what extent the growth of electric passenger cars in the Netherlands between 2018 and 2023 has contributed to changes in CO2, NOx and PM10 emissions. It analyses both total emissions (million kg) and emission intensities (g/km), assessing how they evolved over time and how they related to BEV sales. In addition, it explores whether NOx and PM10 intensities declined faster than CO2 intensity, and whether the results remain robust when excluding 2020, the pandamic year that disrupted traffic volumes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis is based on three national datasets covering the years 2018-2023, containing detailed information on newly sold passenger cars, total kilometres driven in the Netherlands, and emissions per pollutant. \n",
    "\n",
    "By linking emission developments to the rise of electric vehicles, the study provides insight into the effectiveness of vehicle electrification in reducing climate and air-pollution impacts from passenger transport in the Netherlands.   \n"

    "Between 2018 and 2023, total emissions from passenger cars in the Netherlands show a clear downward trend for all three pollutants. This is shown in figure 1 and table 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "CO2 emissions decrease from roughly 17.5 to 15.6 million kg, while NOx falls from about 28.8 to 18.7 million kg, and PM10 remains relatively stable around 2.0 million kg. In the figure of CO2 and PM10 the sharp decline in 2020 coincides with the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to widespread lockdowns, remote working, and reduced travel activity in the Netherlands. As a result, the total number of kilometres driven by passenger cars fell by nearly 15-20% compared to previous years. This reduction in mobility is directly translated into lower total emissions, rather than a structural improvement in vehicle efficiency or technology.  \n",

Over the same period, emission intensities for all measured pollutants CO₂, NOx, and PM₁₀ showed a consistent downward trend, as illustrated in figures 4–6. The calculated correlation coefficients confirm a very strong negative relationship between EV share and emission intensity: r = –0.996 for CO₂, r = –0.922 for NOx, and r = –0.836 for PM₁₀.

    "**Sub-question 4** \n",
    "\n",
    "The projection shows a continued rise in the share of EVs within the Dutch passenger-car fleet, increasing from about 7% in 2023 to roughly 14% in 2030. Correspondingly, the CO₂ emission intensity of passenger cars is expected to decline from around 146 g/km in 2023 to approximately 135 g/km by 2030. This represents an additional 7–8% reduction in average CO₂ emissions per kilometre compared to 2023 levels. \n",
    "\n",
    "The observed historical trend (2018–2023) already demonstrated a strong inverse relationship between EV share and CO₂ intensity (r = –0.996). Extrapolating this pattern with a linear relation suggests that further electrification will continue to lower the carbon intensity of road transport, provided that the increase in EV share follows the projected growth rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, even with this steady improvement, the projected 2030 intensity of around 130–135 g/km remains well above national and European emission targets. The EU’s CO₂ performance standards for new passenger cars require an average of 95 g/km by 2021 and a 55% reduction by 2030, equivalent to roughly 43 g/km for new vehicles(Bron). The Dutch government’s climate objectives are consistent with these targets, aiming for a largely zero-emission new-car fleet by 2030. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the projected trend based on historical growth, while positive, is insufficient to meet 2030 climate targets unless the transition accelerates substantially. Achieving the required emission intensity reduction will likely demand: \n",
    "\n",
    "A much faster increase in EV market share beyond 14% of the fleet (toward 40–50% of new sales). \n",
    "Continued decarbonization of electricity generation to ensure that the life-cycle CO₂ benefits of EVs are fully realized. \n",
    "Policies targeting remaining internal-combustion vehicles through efficiency improvements and taxation incentives. \n",
    "In summary, the long-term growth in EV share is clearly driving down CO₂ emission intensity, but under current growth trajectories, the rate of improvement will not be sufficient to align with 2030 emission targets. A steeper electrification curve and broader systemic measures will be necessary to close the gap. \n",

    "**Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Between 2018 and 2023, the share of electric passenger cars (BEV, PHEV, and FCEV) in the Netherlands increased from around 1.5% to 7.0% of the total fleet. Over the same period, emission intensities for passenger cars declined across all measured pollutants: CO₂ decreased from 160 to 146 g/km, NOx from 0.26 to 0.17 g/km, and PM₁₀ from 0.0206 to 0.0194 g/km. The correlation between EV share and emission intensity was strongly negative for all pollutants, indicating that higher levels of electrification are closely associated with lower emissions per kilometre. The increasing share of EV’s has had the most effect on CO₂ and NOx , while PM₁₀ reductions remained smaller because a significant portion originates from tyre and brake wear, which affects both electric and conventional vehicles. \n",
    "\n",
    "A projection to 2030 indicates that if current growth continues, the fleet’s CO₂ intensity could fall further to about 130–135 g/km. Although this represents meaningful progress, it remains above the EU target of roughly 43 g/km for new vehicles by 2030. Meeting these targets will require a faster transition to fully electric mobility, broader decarbonization of electricity generation, and the gradual phase-out of internal combustion engine vehicles. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the findings show that the electrification of the Dutch passenger-car fleet has already had a clear and measurable impact on reducing emission intensities, but a stronger acceleration in EV adoption will be essential to align future performance with national and European climate goals.

    "**Discussion**\n",
    "\n",
    "During this project, several assumptions were made to ensure that the available data could be meaningfully applied to our research. Currently, we use data representing the total number of electric vehicles (EVs) in the Dutch vehicle fleet. However, this figure does not perfectly reflect the number of vehicles actively driving on Dutch roads. A more precise approach would involve using ownership or registration data to better represent the actual presence and use of EVs in daily traffic. \n",
    "\n",
    "The selected emission indicators (CO₂, NOx, and PM₁₀) were chosen primarily because reliable public data were available for these pollutants. While they are relevant indicators for air quality and climate impact, they may not fully capture the emissions directly attributable to passenger cars. Future studies could investigate in more detail how strongly these emissions are linked to vehicle use and technology, or whether additional emission factors should be included for a more accurate representation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another important limitation concerns the aggregation of different types of electric vehicles. In this study, Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs) were grouped together as “electric vehicles.” While this provides a clear overview of the general electrification trend, it overlooks the differences in emission behaviour between these types. BEVs make up the majority of the group and are fully zero-emission at the tailpipe, whereas PHEVs still rely partly on fossil fuels. Future analyses should therefore separate these categories to better understand the individual contribution of each technology to emission reductions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the projection towards 2030 was based on the least-squares method. Although this technique provides a sound statistical estimate of past linear trends, it does not account for potential exponential growth or decline in EV adoption. In reality, EV uptake is expected to increase more rapidly than predicted by the linear model, driven by technological progress, cost reductions in battery production, and new policy incentives. Moreover, several upcoming policy measures—such as stricter European emission standards and national subsidy programs—are likely to accelerate this transition. As such, the model’s projections may underestimate the actual pace of change and future emission reductions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while this study successfully identifies strong correlations between EV growth and declining emission intensities, several aspects could be improved in future research. Broader datasets covering more years, better differentiation between vehicle types, and more advanced modelling approaches would allow for a more accurate and nuanced understanding of the ongoing electrification of passenger transport in the Netherlands.
